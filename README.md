# Mapping_Earthquakes

## Purpose

This map shows earthquake data over the last seven days. Overlay filters allow the user to toggle between all earthquakes and only earthquakes with a magnitude greater than 4.5. 
An additional overlay shows the location of tectonic plates in the Earth's crust to compare geographically with earthquake locations.
